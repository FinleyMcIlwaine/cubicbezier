cubicbezier
===========

Haskell library for manipulating cubic bezier curves.  The original goal
is to support typography, but it may be useful for general graphics.

Planned features are:

 * calculation of outlines
 * finding intersection points
 * finding tangents parallel to a vector
 * finding curvature
 * creating paths from meta paths (as in D.E.Knuth's _metafont_)
 * adding and subtracting closed paths
 * removing overlap from paths
 * approximating cubic paths with quadratic bezier curves.
